In git hub there are codes that can be saved to remote repo and will be pulled back inorder to update or delete changes.
This can be done by adding the file into repo and saving it. there are severeal ways to do that.
Firstly, save the text file in to a directory and initialise git in that directory. This will help git to track the history of changes
Then we will stage the file from our local repo to the staging area
After that we can commit the file to the repo.
Then we will connect our local repo to the remote repo
after connecting to repo, we can push changes into our remote repo
