In git hub there are codes that can be saved to remote repo and will be pulled back inorder to update or delete changes.
This can be done by adding the file into repo and saving it. there are severeal ways to do that.
Firstly, save the text file in to a directory and initialise git in that directory. This will help git to track the history of changes
Then we will stage the file from our local repo to the staging area
After that we can commit the file to the repo.
Then we will connect our local repo to the remote repo
after connecting to repo, we can push changes into our remote repo

Now we have created a branch and a new file alled contents.text
We will add some changes to the file and we will try to merge it with our file in master branch.
after that we will check whether we are following the process or not.
For this we need to create a branch in our remote repo then add some file to it and we will commit to and try to pull and merge the two files
